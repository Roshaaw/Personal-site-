              <td>I was born on january 4th in Iran. I spent my childhood in the capital of Iran, tehran. 
                My grandpa and one of my aunt's lived in teh same apartment buliding as us so I was always close to my family. 
                Almost eveyday my cousins and I would gather the other girls in building to go paly in the backyard, and each weekends was resered for visiting our grandparents.
                I had cousins around my age on both sides of teh family so we would always cause chaos and trouble together.</td>
              <td>I went to Raziyeh elementary school. 
                On the fisrt day of fisrt grade i told the person sitting next to me a false fact about cows  to stricke a conversation. 
                Later on she figured out it was a lie but we became best friends so it doesn't matter. 
                One the second day of fisrt grade a girl who was absent sat beside me and instantly we became "enemis". 
                But it only lasted until the summer becuase our mothers had decided to put us in the same swimming classes.
                We started to get along and eventually became friends. Aside from making amazing friends school in Iran was difficult.
                We wore gray and dark blue uniforms and had to have our hijab on everywhere except our own classroom, even though it was all girls school.
                The number of subjects we studied and the material in each subject was overwhelming 
                but the teachers always insited for extar workbooks that werent required by the district.</td>
              <td>When i was in 7th grade my father won the immigration lattery. Some countries like United states and Canada have a lottery 
                in which they allows people from certain coutries to submit their application for immigration.  
                When the time comes the announce winners but that doesnt mean now you are able to move to that country. 
                It means now you are eligiable to apply for a visa.
                There are many steps and barrier depending on where you live. 
                For our case we had to go another country for teh interview because U.S does have a Embassy in Iran. 
                That was one of the easiest parts.
                Overall it is a very long and complicted process and at the end you might even get a visa.
                But with many ups and downs my family and I got our visa.</td>

            Narges was a middle school located in Tajrish providence, tehran. 
            It is an all girls school, and it's considered to be a good public school.
            It also has an elementary school attached to it; however, 
            I only attended the middle school.I have many good memories from that time. 
            I didn't have any friends when i started there 
            but soon i got to know other students and find friends.<br></p>

          <p>This was an all girls school with big backyard. Everyday 30 minutes before the end of the school day
            they wouldnt allow students to go ouside of their class 
            for drinking water or using the bathroom 
            becasue it was time for school services to come to the yard. 
            They didnt want to have any of the kids getting hurt while running around with vechiles moving. 
            We dont have any yellow school busses in Iran. 
            We have green vans kids can use or normal cars. </p>

          <p> In the states schools have cafees and students can get/buy lunch or sit down and enjoy their food. 
            We didnt have any cafees that would serve lunch or a place at school were you could buy snacks. 
            Some private schools did but most of us just had to bring something from home
            or ask our friends to share with us.</p>
